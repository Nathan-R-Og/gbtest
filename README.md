# Game Boy Example
an example of a gameboy game written in pure assembly. buildable from source with RGBDS.

use `./install` to install RGBDS

use `./build` to build a functional rom

for some reason I can barely find any examples like this online???? so im making one myself.

this is a growing organism. as i learn more this will learn more

current examples included are:

- Basic Game Loop
- Re-drawing BG tiles
- Player Input + Subpixel movement
- Image inclusion
- OAM tile drawing (with shadow oam)
- "Camera"
- Hardware Interrupts
- Window Layer Usage

a lot of this ive copied from random tutorials and the images are probably the best indication of that

feel free to add more. more complex examples welcome
